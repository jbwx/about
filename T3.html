T3.cmd
<p>
This was a fun code-golfing project that I worked on around February of 2021. The goal was to make a version of tic-tac-toe that automatically checked for wins, and was compacted into a file-size as small as possible. What made this different was the language (or script, rather)
that was being used. The Windows CMD script has some quite interesting features which I haven't seen in other scripts, such as the following mechanic:
<p>
<gray style="color:gray;">
	set var=echo
<br>
	%var% Hello, world!
<p>
</gray>
<p>
Output:
<br>
<b>
Hello, world!
<p>
</b>
In this script, variables are updated in runtime and are handled as if plain-text. I am unaware of any other script that does this, which is what made it ideal for this project. It allowed me to save a few bytes by shrinking commonly-used phrases into variables with short names, such as %a%, %b%, %c%, etc...
<p>
The final size ended up being 457 bytes when compressed, which is small enough to fit on a version-10 QR code with room to spare.
<p>
As far as I am aware, this is the most compact version of Tic-Tac-Toe that exists. Considering that 
<a contenteditable="false" style="text-decoration:none;" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/BootChess" target="_self">BootChess</a>
is only 30 bytes larger, there is undoubtedly room for improvement using some other language or script.
